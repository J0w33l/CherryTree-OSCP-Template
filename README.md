# CherryTree-OSCP-Template
This repo includes a CherryTree template (.ctb) designed for OSCP-style or general pentesting workflows. It covers the key phases—reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation, and more—so you can jump right into note-taking instead of building a new structure every time and finally convert your taking note into a Report.
